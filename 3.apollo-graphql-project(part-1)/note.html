- To build our homepage grid feature, we used a schema-first approach, meaning we considered data needs from the client's perspective before even starting to code.

- We defined our schema and used Apollo Server to build a basic GraphQL endpoint that provides mocked responses.

- We then used the Apollo Studio Explorer to interactively build queries from our development graph.

- Finally, we developed the client side of our Catstronauts app. We used React, Apollo Client, and the useQuery Hook to perform a query on our GraphQL server to display our tracks in a nice grid card layout.
